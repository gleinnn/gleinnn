### Hi there 👋
I'm Calvin, a 1<sup>st</sup> year student studying Mechatronic and Robotics Engineering in University of Birmingham.

I've been making little programming projects in my spare time since primary school, but I've only recently learnt how Github works, so here are some of the things I can do and projects I've been making during my time at UOB. :)

## Things I can do 🤔
Programming Languages:
- Python 🐍

Programs I've used:

- Unity
